### [Project Description](doc/)
This is the first and only *individual* (as opposed to *team*) project this semester. 

**Term:** Spring 2022

**Project title:** Feel the Philosophy: Insight into Schools and Authors

This project is conducted by Aakanksha Agarwal (UNI - aa4863)

**Project summary:**

For the project, I used the philosphy data with more than 350 thousand rows to understand the underlying 'School of thoughts' of philosophy and also the authors who have contributed towards it. I utilized Python libraries for plots, text mining, word cloud and sentiment analysis for the same. 

The analyses are divided into four sections:

* Timelines for 'School of Thoughts'
* Most frequently used words among the schools and how they fit with the thought principle
* Do the School of thoughts overlap?
* Looking into the Philosophers:
    * How the sentence complexity varies for each author?
    * Emotion and Sentiment analysis for each author
